# Go Project Template

Defines a project layout for simple Golang projects. Two main folders are provided as part of the template:

* cmd: contains the main.go file of the module.
* pkg: contains code that is usable for external applications.

Some common tasks such as fetching dependencies, building and running generated binary are automated through a Makefile.
